## Trough convergence test

* Test to see if elastic SL is calculated correctly for rigid medium due to ice melt 
* This is simply a question of 'does the ice mass melted correspond to the water mass gained'
* Initial MPI stuff is added to code so can run in parallel 
* Early tests indicate that the mass balance converges on correct solution with increasing mesh resolution
* Here I formally test some different mesh resolutions to see the effects
